LeetCode #433 - Minimum Genetic Mutation
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: BFS, String Transformation

Problem: Find minimum mutations to transform startGene to endGene
where each mutation changes one character and result must be in bank.

Approach: BFS where each gene is a node and neighbors are valid
mutations (1 character different, must be in bank). Same pattern
as Word Ladder but with only 4 possible characters (A, C, G, T).

Key Insight: String transformation BFS - neighbors are strings
that differ by exactly 1 character. Same concept as grid BFS
but "movement" is changing a letter instead of moving a cell.

Date Solved: February 18, 2026

assictance - did it basically fully with ai then did word ladder
to see if I really understood how then came back the next day and 
did it in 6 mins
