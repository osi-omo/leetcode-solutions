LeetCode #695 - Max Area of Island
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: BFS, Graph

Problem: Given a 2D grid of 1's (land) and 0's (water), find the maximum 
area of an island. An island is a group of connected 1's.

Approach: Similar to Number of Islands, but instead of just counting islands, 
we count the size of each island and track the maximum.
