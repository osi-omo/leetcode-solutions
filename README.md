 Current Focus

Week 1-2:** BFS & DFS Mastery
-Multi-source BFS learned!
- Grid traversal patterns mastered
- Distance calculation techniques


Topics
- Graph traversal
- Multi-source BFS
- Connected components
- Distance calculation

key learning week 1 
Multi-source BFS: Instead of running BFS from each destination to find 
the nearest source, run ONE BFS from all sources simultaneously. 

Pattern Recognition: Rotting Oranges and 01 Matrix use the exact same 
pattern - just different applications (time vs distance).
