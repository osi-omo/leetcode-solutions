My competitive programming journey - preparing for Summer 2027 internship

Current Progress
Total Problems so far: 12
- Easy: 1
- Medium: 10
- Hard: 1

 Current Focus

Week 1-2:** BFS & DFS Mastery
-Multi-source BFS learned!
- Grid traversal patterns mastered
- Distance calculation techniques

Week 1 complete
Topics
- Graph traversal
- Multi-source BFS
- Connected components
- Distance calculation
- string manipulation

key learning week 1 
Multi-source BFS: Instead of running BFS from each destination to find 
the nearest source, run ONE BFS from all sources simultaneously. 

Pattern Recognition: Rotting Oranges and 01 Matrix use the exact same 
pattern - just different applications (time vs distance).

Day 4 Milestone: Solved a Medium problem in just 16 minutes! Pattern 
recognition is clicking.

day 5 Milestone: solved my first hard problem

string manipulation: to check strings using BFS is the same as grid but 
rather than new row and new column, you just check for a new word and 
like grid see if it matches without already being checked

Week 1 Average:** ~30 minutes/problem → ~15 minutes/problem

Types of Bfs done
- Single-source BFS
- Multi-source BFS 
- Grid BFS (4 & 8 directions) 
- String transformation BFS 
- State-based BFS 
- Island problems 

- Week 1 Average:** ~30 minutes/problem → ~15 minutes/problem
