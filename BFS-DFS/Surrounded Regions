LeetCode #130 - Surrounded Regions
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: BFS, Island Detection

Problem: Capture all regions of 'O' that are completely surrounded 
by 'X'. Regions touching the border are not captured.

Approach: For each unvisited 'O', use BFS to find the entire connected 
island. During BFS, check if any cell in the island touches the border. 
If the island is completely surrounded (no border cells), flip all 
cells to 'X'.

Key Insight: Track both global visited set (across all islands) and 
per-island cells. Check border condition during BFS traversal.
